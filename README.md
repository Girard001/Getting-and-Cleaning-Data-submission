This is the README file submitted for the course project for the Getting
and Cleaning Data class.

The GitHub repository “Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-submission” contains
the following files:

*README.md *CodeBook.md *run\_analysis.R (script) *tidy\_summary.csv

There are two steps in this project. First, assemble a dataset of 10299
observations of 30 Subjects doing 6 Activities for which 66 feature
variables (of means and standard deviations) are recorded. This work is
produced by Sections 1 through 6 of the “run\_analysis” script file.

Second, a dataset is created containing the average (mean) for each of
the 66 feature variables by Subject and Activity. This work is produced
by Section 7 of the “run\_analysis” script file.

This work is based on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
Dataset (Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, David
Anguita. November, 2012). The following datasets are used:

\*For Section 1 of the script +train/X\_train.txt - main training
dataset +train/y\_train.txt - training Activity dataset
+subject\_train.txt - training Subject dataset

\*For Section 2 of the script +test/X\_test.tx - main testing dataset
+test/y\_test.txt - testing Activity dataset +subject\_test.txt -
testing Subject dataset

\*For Section 4 of the script +features.txt - feature variable labels
dataset

\*For Section 6 of the script +activity\_labels.txt - Activity coding
dataset
